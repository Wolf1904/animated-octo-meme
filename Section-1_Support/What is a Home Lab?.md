>Home Lab --> Virtual Machine

- Building a vm (virtual machine) and learning hands on skills.
- You can also learn and gain valuable experience by building a lab for helpdesk, server admin, or network admin.

## What do you need for it?

- Decent rig with windows 10 pro on it. Home edition may not work with hyper-v/virtualization. You can use a laptop but make sure it has pro on it and virtualization is allowed in the bios. 
- Specs for vms? Laptop/pc 16gb ram at least and 250 gb hard drive space. Buy a cheap used pc or desktop on ebay/amazon or pc part picker.

## What are the benefits? 
- Gain valuable experience to market yourself.
- Doesn't affect your regular pc. (you can always delete it and start all over again from a snapshot) 
- You can talk about it during a job interview 
- You can replicate an issue a user having on their pc in your vm and figured out how to fix it. (your basically reverse engineering the process of fixing something) 
- Gives you something to add as experience on the resume Builds confidence

## Example Of Home Labs
- You can watch my helpdesk playlist. I cover active directory, ticket system, password reset, rsat tools, share drives, pc fell off the domain.
- Another example of a home lab is getting it for free with Microsoft azure and using the credit money to set up server 2019 and adding ad connect to it to your Azure active directory account.
- Another example of this is using a real cisco router, cisco set up by Du'an Lightfoot (YouTube)
- Cybersecurity labs (tryhackme, hackthebox, pentesterlab, rangeforce)

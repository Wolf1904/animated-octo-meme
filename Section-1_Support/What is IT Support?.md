#Introduction
## Resume, Hands on Experience, Connections 

- A lot of it has to do with your resume. If you have a weak resume, no one will call you. 
- If you get an interview and don't get the job, it can be a lot of reasons. Interview skills, soft skills or something else like body language. 
- Connect with people on social platforms like Linkedin (it's who you know sometimes) 
- Have a mentor (someone who can talk too) 
- Build your own lab at home (Gives you something to talk about) 
- Follow tech communities on discord, what's app, LinkedIn etc. 
- Apply everywhere. Apply until someone opens the door for you. If you get no calls, take a step back and look at the resume again.
- **Prepared that mind for rejection. You have no job experience so it takes time. You will get rejected but the important thing is to not give up on applying for jobs.**

## Proper way talking to someone on the phone

Three different things should be consider:
- **Be happy**, keep smiling while to the phone.
- A **common greet** that makes you **sound smooth and good** on the phone and the makes you **sound confident** on the phone.
- **End phase.**

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1

- You have a **ticket**. And you see the *client is having an issue* and he is *frustrated about it*.
- So, you've to **empathise with the customer**. You have to **know how to talk to the customer**.

### Scenario 2

- You're *having an issue with someone* in there and *they're frustrated.*
- And you *don't know how to empathise with decline.* You *don't know how to how to put your yourself in their shoes*.

- So, you have to **know how to properly talk to the person that you're on with on the phone to**, basically **talk to them like a regular human being**.
- **Don't use technical** jargon and properly know how to talk to them.

### Scenario 3

- You *don't know how to fox the issue*.
- But you *want to assure the customer* or the client or the user *that you'll get back to them*.

- So it would be something like, I'll get back to you.
- You don't say, <u><b>I never seen this issue before</b></u>. You say, <u><b>I'll get back to you</b></u>.
 
- They may look into this for you.
- **''I'll get back to you''** or say something like, **"I will escalate this or I will talk to someone to see if anyone else has seen this issue before."**

- Sometimes the issue has been **seen before or closed out before**.
- And basically you got to **go into your queue or your tickets** and see maybe **someone's fixed an issue** before you go. 
- Now, **check your ticketing system**. Maybe someone has **seen this issue before and fix this issue**.

>And that's the way that's the basic way of talking.
>It's not complicated.

>And so *every scenario would be something like*:
>- Good morning, Good afternoon.
>- I hope you have a good day.
>- Is there anything else I can help you with?
>- Is it is this is this issue only affecting you?
>- Is anyone else having this issue?
>- Do you need me to look at me?
>- Look into anything else?
>- If you have any other issues, feel free to let me know.
>- And feel free to let me know.
>- An email hub this morning.

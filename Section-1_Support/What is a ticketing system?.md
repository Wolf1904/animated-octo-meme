## IT System

- Make sure to ask if **the company has a wiki to help with IT issues** (some companies have a wiki or a confluence page).
- **Google is your best friend too** (Remember no one knows everything).
- Ask **when do we need approval for something** (I'm sure they will let you know, each company does training on this).
- Remember since your new, they will **slowly give you access to everything**.
- Remember it's a not race. **Take your time and learn as much as you can**.
- It **usually takes someone 2-3 months to learn the basics** of the company systems.

## Ticket System

- **Understand where the tickets go**
- Whenever **you close a ticket put notes on it.**
- Why notes? You might **see that issue again**
- Be sure to **attached any approval emails on the ticket or notes inside the ticket**
- Use the ticket system to your **advantage by looking at old tickets**
- **Follow up on tickets** that were assigned to you if you **gave it to someone else like level 2**
- Always **update your tickets everyday** (<u>managers check this</u>)
- Always **communicate with the client after closing a ticket**. Don't just close the ticket because you feel like it.

## Customer Service (Understanding The Customer)

### Customer Service

- **Having Empathy for the customer** (For example: *I'm sorry to hear that*, *Please let me help you*, *I'm sorry your having this issue*, *Let's work together to resolve it*)
- **Follow up with the user**
- **Don't lie to the client**
- **Don't get too technical**
- **Don't act like your know everything**
- **Resolve the issue 100 percent** so this doesn't go to someone else
- **Behave professionally** and don't make negative comments
- **Don't threaten anyone**
- **Remember the client is upset at the computer** or software **not at you**
- **All they care about is that it's working or it's fixed**
